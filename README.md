Kitcade Arcade Frontend
=======================


What is this?
-------------

Kitkade is an frontend for [Arcade Cabinets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet), written in Javascript and based on node-webkit.

Kitcade is designed to be used with a controllerboard, so you don't need a keyboard to launch your favorite emulators.

What is this not?
-----------------

Kitcade has no emulators or roms included. You have to provide those yourself and configure Kitcade to launch them.
